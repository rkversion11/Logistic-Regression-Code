# Logistic-Regression-Code
Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks (i.e., classifying data into one of two categories). Despite its name, logistic regression is actually a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm.

Key Concepts:
Goal: Predict the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class.
Output: Returns probabilities between 0 and 1 using the sigmoid function. Predictions are typically converted into binary values using a threshold (e.g., 0.5).
Model:
The algorithm fits a linear model (z = wX + b) to the data.
Applies the sigmoid function to map the linear output to probabilities.
Decides the class based on whether the probability is above or below the threshold.
Mathematical Representation:
Sigmoid Function: σ(z)=
frac11+e^−z

 
Decision Boundary:  If 𝜎(𝑧)> 0.5 σ(z)>0.5, predict 1; otherwise, predict 0.
Applications:
Spam detection (email: spam vs not spam)
Medical diagnosis (disease: present vs absent)
Customer churn prediction (churn: yes vs no)
Advantages:
Simple and efficient for binary classification.
Outputs probabilities, offering interpretability.
Extends to multiclass problems using techniques like One-vs-Rest (OvR).
Limitations:
Assumes a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the outcome.
Can struggle with complex datasets unless feature engineering is applied.
